## IT'S FINALLY LIVE!

I'm happy to announce that blog posts are now live on the website!
This is a significant improvement to the website, and I'm excited to start writing more blog posts in the future.

## Other news

Since I've graduated from grade 9, now enrolled in grade 10 <span style="color: var(--neutral-variant-low)">(enrolling in Math + Computer Science was a mistake ðŸ¤£)</span>.
I've had less time to work on the website, but I'm still trying to make small but significant improvements to the website.

*Hope you have a good day/night!*
