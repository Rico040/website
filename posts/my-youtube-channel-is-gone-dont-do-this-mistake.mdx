Hello, people on the internet! My YouTube channel had recently been permanently deleted, without any notification or emails.

I have no active strikes on the channel, and haven't uploaded in over a year. However, I still had around 2,000 subscribers on it, and about a million views!

## Why was it deleted?

No, it's not the usual *"YouTube terminates channels unfairly"*. It's rather about the wacky Brand Accounts system.

You see, Brand Accounts in the present can be made and tied to a specific YouTube channel. You can then add Brand Account owners, and managers, essentially making your YouTube channel manageable by multiple people. This is very useful for large content creators who have teams working for them.

Well, what happens when there are no owners on the Brand Account. Surely the Brand Account doesn't just get deleted right..., RIGHT?

<span style="color:var(--tertiary)">Bad news.</span> When you have a Brand Account that doesn't have any owners, the Brand Account simply gets nuked from existence. No emails, no cooldown period, nothing. Even if there's a manager on the Brand Account.

## How was my Brand Account deleted?

I recently made a new Google account because my old email has been leaked in many places and that resulted in a lot of spam emails.

I decided that the new email is what I'm going to be using from now on, so I transferred my Brand Account over to my new Google Account, making the new Google Account the primary owner, while making the old Google Account a manager.

Of course, my naive self thought *"Surely nothing can go wrong with this"*, but you probably already see where this is going.

## Timeline

### Jan 6, 5:51 AM

My new Google Account was disabled for suspicious activity. I just had to add a phone number though, so that wasn't really a problem for me.

### Jan 6, 1:07 PM

I've recovered the new Google account.

### Jan 10, 11:02 AM

I've noticed my YouTube channel was gone from every account switcher.

### Jan 10, 11:32 AM

I've contacted YouTube support regarding the issue.

### Jan 10, 9:40 PM

YouTube Support finally responded, being unable to restore my YouTube channel.

## So what happened?

Apparently, because my new Google account had been disabled earlier. My Brand Account was also deleted automatically because there was no "active owner" on the Brand Account (only a manager, which was my old Google account).

This deletion happened immediately and I have no emails or notification regarding it happening. I've only realized it was deleted because I was trying to log in to it but it wasn't there in the account switcher.

## Don't do this mistake

So what can you learn from this? **ALWAYS** have a spare Google account as an **Owner** on your Brand Account. This way, if one of the owner accounts gets disabled, the Brand Account won't be automatically deleted.

That may sound like a security risk, but it's better than waking up and realizing your YouTube channel is gone forever. Just secure the spare account with 2FA, and that'd probably already be good enough.

I've also made a few suggestions via the support feedback form, so they can fix this issue.

## Thank you!

Thank you for reading to the end! I hope it was at least entertaining to go through my rant.

If you want more blog posts like this, let me know somewhere, whether that'd be mentioning me on Discord or just sending an email *([contact info here!](/#contact))*.
