Hello, people on the internet! My YouTube channel had recently been permanently deleted without me knowing. Here's what happened and what you shouldn't do.

I have no active strikes on the channel, and haven't uploaded in over a year. However, I still had around 2,000 subscribers on it, and about a million views!

## Some context

I recently made a new Google account because my old email has been leaked in many places resulting in me receiving a lot of spam emails.

I decided that this new account is what I'm going to be using from now on, so I transferred my Brand Account over to my new Google Account, making the new Google Account the primary owner, while making the old Google Account a manager.

I've also created a personal YouTube account/channel on the new Google Account, which is not tied to the Brand Account or the YouTube channel in any way.

## How was my Brand Account deleted?

No, it's not the usual *"YouTube terminates channels unfairly"*. It's rather about the wacky Brand Accounts system and Google's horrible UX with it.

You see, Brand Accounts in the present can be made and tied to a specific YouTube channel. You can then add Brand Account owners and managers, essentially making your YouTube channel manageable by multiple people. This is very useful for large content creators who have teams working for them.

Well, what happens if you try to delete the **YouTube service data** of the **Brand Account's primary owner**? Surely this unrelated action wouldn't result in the unforseen deletion of the **entire Brand Account**, right?

<sub>As you've probably guessed, it does.</sub>

If you're still confused, let me break it down for you. This is what I had:

- **Owner**
  - **Personal Account**
    - **YouTube channel**
  - **Brand Account**
    - **YouTube channel**

When you attempt to delete the YouTube service data of **Owner** *(intending to delete the **Personal Account**'s **YouTube channel**)*...

For some reason, Google decides to delete **ALL** **YouTube channel**s, including the **Brand Account**'s. And since the **Brand Account** is now empty, Google automatically deletes the **Brand Account** as well.

---

Not to mention, the **Remove YouTube content** page of **Owner** does not even mention that it will delete the Brand Account's YouTube channels! Why, Google?

## So, what should you not do?

**Don't delete YouTube service data when you have ownership of a Brand Account.** It's as simple as that.

If you really need to, try transfering ownership to another account and kicking yourself off the Brand Account before attempting.

<sub>I have not tested this, but it *should* work.</sub>

## Thank you!

Thank you for reading to the end! I hope it was at least entertaining to go through my rant.

If you want more blog posts like this, let me know somewhere, whether that'd be mentioning me on Discord or just sending an email *([contact info here!](/#contact))*.

Anyway, here's an image that I was gonna put on the post, but it got scrapped:
